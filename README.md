# Terrestrial-and-marine-ecospace-through-the-ETE
Data and code for the manuscript "Contrasting terrestrial and marine ecospace dynamics after the end-Triassic mass extinction event" by Cribb A.T., Formoso, K.K., Woolley, C.H., Beech, J., Brophy, S.K., Byrne, P., Cassady, V.C., Godbold, A.L., Larina, E., Maxeiner, P., Wu, Y.H., Corsetti, F.A., and Bottjer, D. J. 

The purpose of these analyses is to reconstruct comparative trends in marine and terrestrial functional ecology across the end-Triassic mass extinction event. The analyses scripts utilize the datasets compiled by the manuscript's authors, which assign ecospace functional groups to data from the PaleoDB. The code in this github repository will produce all of the outputs necessary to recreate the figures in the manuscript's main text. Analyses for the suppleentary material are not explicitly given here, but they can be easily reconstructed from the output files.

Please contact Alison Cribb (cribb@usc.edu) for any questions or if you plan to use and edit these scripts in any way.

*The R scripts in this repository were created by A.T.C.
